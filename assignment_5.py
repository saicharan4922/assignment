# Problem statement: Implement a class Point that has three properties and a method. All these attributes (properties and methods) should be public. This problem can be broken down into two tasks:

# Task 1: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a constructor to initialize the values of three properties: x, y, and z.

# Task 2: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a method, sqSum(), in the Point class which squares x, y, and z and returns their sum.

# Sample properties 1, 3, 5

# Sample method output 35

# Challenge 2: Implement a Calculator Class
# ðŸ”´ In this exercise, you have to implement a calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Problem statement Write a Python class called Calculator by completing the tasks below:

# Task 1

# ðŸ‘‰ Initializer

# Implement an initializer to initialize the values of num1 and num2. Properties

# â€¢ num1
# â€¢ num2
# Task 2

# ðŸ‘‰ Methods

# â€¢ add() is a method that returns the sum of num1 and num2.
# â€¢ subtract() is a method that returns the subtraction of num1 from num2.
# â€¢ multiply() is a method that returns the product of num1 and num2.
# â€¢ divide() is a method that returns the division of num2 by num1.
# Input - Pass numbers (integers or floats) in the initializer.

# Output - addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication

# Sample input

# obj = Calculator(10, 94)
# obj.add()
# obj.subtract()
# obj.multiply()
# obj.divide()
# Sample output

# Problem statement

# Implement the complete Student class by completing the tasks below

# Task

# ðŸ‘‰ Implement the following properties as private:

# â€¢ name

# ðŸ‘‰ Include the following methods to get and set the private properties above:

# â€¢ getName()
# â€¢ setName()
# â€¢ getRollNumber()
# â€¢ setRollNumber()
# ðŸ‘‰ Implement this class according to the rules of encapsulation.

# Input - Checking all the properties and methods

# Output - Expecting perfectly defined fields and getter/setters

# Note: Do not use initializers to initialize the properties. Use the set methods to do so.

# If the setter is not defined properly, the corresponding getter will also generate an error even if the getter is defined properly.
